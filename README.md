Just copy paste the code into a new class and you are good to go.

Click anywhere to add points to a polygon.

A ghostimage will appear after you've added one point.

When you are done stop the script and check the output in IDE.

The output will display text to construct a Rectangle or a Polygon based on your information. (thanks for the idea @Chris in your youtube series)

(When you want to stop the script the ghost image will drag towards the corner, but yeah...)

In the file there are also methods to select a random point within the rectangle / polygon.

There is also the code how to click a point (kinda obvious but wanted to list the whole flow)
